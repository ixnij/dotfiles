* .emacs.d

This is a very lightweight emacs configuretion file, with vim-keybinding(evil).

I place the non-elpa packages in /site-lisp/ directly.

I think it's ugly that manage the non-elpa packages
using git submodule(That's only a very *personal* opinion).

I don't use use-package or leaf.el, but require-package from purcell.
