* Overview

This is my configuration files repository.

I am a emacs newbie, so... ;-)

** Requirements

*** OnMac

- [[https://github.com/d12frosted/homebrew-emacs-plus][Emacs Plus]]: It's the best choice to run emacs. I think it's enough for me.
  And, [[https://github.com/d12frosted/homebrew-emacs-plus/blob/master/patches/emacs-28/system-appearance.patch][they]] are the patches it use.
- Ispell: A good tool, as it's name, it's used for checking and completing words
- Zsh and Yash: They are my usual shell programs
