* Overview

This is my configuration files repository.
It's very personal, so, *do not use*.

** Requirements

1) Emacs 29+ :: It's *really important*
2) Ispell :: Emacs needs it
3) ripgrep :: written in rust, faster than ag or grep
4) fd :: written in rust, faster than gnu or bsd find
5) neovim 0.6+ :: I'm using 0.7
6) gls :: GNU coreutils ls, =--dired= option is needed
