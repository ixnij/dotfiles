* Overview

This is my configuration files repository.
It's very personal, so, *do not use*.

** Requirements

1) Emacs 29+ :: It's *really important*
2) zsh 5.8+ :: shell on unix systems, or using darwin built-in
3) Ispell :: Emacs needs it
4) ripgrep :: written in rust, faster than ag or grep
5) fd :: written in rust, faster than gnu or bsd find
6) neovim 0.6+ :: I'm using 0.7
7) gls :: GNU coreutils ls, =--dired= option is needed
